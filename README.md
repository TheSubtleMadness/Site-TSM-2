# Site-TSM is the repository I created in order to submit the IMED1316 Web Design final project. 
It contains a "template"/mock-up of a 4-page modern, professional, and responsive website, using Bootstrap v5.2's 12-grid system as the foundation.

Created with CodeSandbox.

This copied template will be used to make a template variation in order to quickly develop multiple variations of this simple site.
