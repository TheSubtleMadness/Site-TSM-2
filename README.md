# Site-TSM is the repository I created in order to submit the IMED1316 Web Design final project. 
It contains a "template"/mock-up of a 4-page modern, professional, and responsive website, using Bootstrap v5.2's 12-grid system as the foundation.

Created with CodeSandbox.

For the subject of this project, I chose the Dallas, TX rock band, The Subtle Madness, of which I am part, creating a website for us.  Now that the class is over, I'll be using this template to create the actual site and others as time allows.
